# Architecture

## Overview

Single-page React app running inside a Power Platform Code App host iframe. All data access goes through generated Dataverse services provided by the `@microsoft/power-apps` SDK — no direct HTTP calls.

## Runtime Model

```
Browser
  └─ Power Platform host iframe
       └─ Code App (this SPA)
            └─ Generated services → Dataverse Web API (via host proxy)
```

The `pac code run` proxy bridges local dev to the Dataverse environment. In production, the Power Platform host handles auth and routing.

## Layers

### UI Components (`src/components/`)

- **`accounts/`** — Account list (table/card toggle), detail dialog, form dialog, delete confirmation
- **`contacts/`** — Contact list (table/card toggle), detail dialog, form dialog, delete confirmation
- **`action-items/`** — Action item list redesigned with `--dash-*` design system (Phase 27): orchestrator (`action-item-list.tsx`) with saved-view tabs (All/Overdue/High priority/Due this week), subtoolbar filter pills (Group by Account toggle, Type/Priority/Status dropdowns, density Compact/Rich toggle), `action-items-toolbar.tsx` (icon tile + eyebrow + h1 + search + export + new), `action-items-table.tsx` (sortable columns, collapsible account groups with 2-letter avatar + status distribution bar, priority rails, type-icon tiles, overdue badges, activity dots, row selection), `action-items-bulk-bar.tsx` (Framer Motion floating bar with Mark complete + Delete). Table-only — no card view. Detail dialog, form dialog, delete confirmation, shared label/variant helpers unchanged
- **`meeting-summaries/`** — Meeting Summary list (table/card toggle), detail dialog, form dialog, delete confirmation; account lookup + summary textarea; AI extraction dialog (`extract-action-items-dialog.tsx`) that calls Azure OpenAI to pull action items from meeting notes
- **`ideas/`** — Idea list (table/card toggle), detail dialog, form dialog, delete confirmation; category choice field + account, contact, and project lookups, shared label/variant helpers
- **`projects/`** — Project list (table/card toggle), detail dialog, form dialog, delete confirmation; account lookup, priority choice field, shared label/variant helpers
- **`dashboard/`** — Two views, both using the `--dash-*` design system: (1) Analytics dashboard — a Stripe/Retool-inspired data-forward design decomposed into 8 sub-components imported by a ~225-line orchestrator (`dashboard.tsx`). Uses Inter font, `--dash-*` CSS custom properties, pure SVG/CSS charts. Sub-components: `dashboard-tokens.ts`, `page-header.tsx`, `focus-strip.tsx`, `kpi-card.tsx`, `status-breakdown.tsx` (exports `CardShell`), `priority-distribution.tsx`, `task-types.tsx`, `items-by-account.tsx`. (2) Kanban board — also decomposed (Phase 26) into sub-components: `board-tokens.ts` (shared constants, pill styles, type configs, card/entry types), `board-toolbar.tsx` (icon tile + filter pills + segmented control + new button), `board-card.tsx` (`BoardCard` + `ParkingLotCard` with priority rails, type-icon tiles, inline Pill, overdue badges, activity dots, hover toolbar), `board-column.tsx` (`BoardColumn` with dnd-kit sortable, sticky header, accent stripe, WIP badges, Framer Motion entrance, drop glow), and `board-dashboard.tsx` orchestrator (data fetching, drag-and-drop, edit dialog state). Four columns: parking lot, work (2fr width, task-type filter), projects, ideas. `@dnd-kit` with custom collision detection. Cards are clickable, flat `--dash-surface` surfaces (no glassmorphism), hover lift. Sort order persists in localStorage
- **`layout/`** — App shell with collapsible left vertical sidebar (Briefcase icon + "My Work" brand, grouped nav: insights, activity, capture, core). Sidebar collapses to 56px icon-only rail via a floating chevron toggle button; state persists in `localStorage`. When collapsed, nav items show centered icons with hover tooltips to the right; section labels become thin dividers; footer buttons show icons only. Nav icons are color-matched to quick creates (red, emerald, pink, violet, teal, sky). Dark mode toggle (Sun/Moon icon) in sidebar footer. Top horizontal quick create bar with colored pill buttons (dark-aware variants): work, personal, learning (task-type presets), idea, meeting, project, account, contact. Work/personal/learning pills pre-set `tdvsp_tasktype` on action item forms via `QuickCreatePayload`
- **`command-palette.tsx`** — Global Ctrl+K search dialog (cmdk + shadcn Dialog). Searches TanStack Query cache client-side across all entities. Must be rendered inside `<HashRouter>` because it uses `useNavigate()`
- **`copilot-chat.tsx`** — Floating Copilot Studio agent button. Opens the Copilot Studio webchat in a popup window (`window.open`) so the agent handles its own auth natively. No iframe, no Direct Line, no MSAL, no `botframework-webchat`. Blue gradient floating button (bottom-right, `MessageCircle` icon). Clicking opens a popup; clicking again focuses the existing popup or opens a new one if closed
- **`ui/`** — shadcn/ui primitives (Button, Dialog, Table, Select, etc.) + `ViewToggle` component for list/card view switching + `TileColorDots` component for priority color-coding on cards. Table component uses compact density (`h-8` headers, `py-1.5` cells)
- **`theme-provider.tsx`** — React context for light/dark theme toggling. Persists in localStorage, respects OS `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit. Toggles `.dark` class on `<html>`

### Data Hooks (`src/hooks/`)

- `use-accounts.ts` — TanStack Query hooks wrapping `AccountsService` (CRUD + cache invalidation)
- `use-contacts.ts` — TanStack Query hooks wrapping `ContactsService` (CRUD + cross-entity cache invalidation for accounts)
- `use-action-items.ts` — TanStack Query hooks wrapping `Tdvsp_actionitemsService` (CRUD + cache invalidation)
- `use-meeting-summaries.ts` — TanStack Query hooks wrapping `Tdvsp_meetingsummariesService` (CRUD + cache invalidation)
- `use-ideas.ts` — TanStack Query hooks wrapping `Tdvsp_ideasService` (CRUD + cache invalidation)
- `use-projects.ts` — TanStack Query hooks wrapping `Tdvsp_projectsService` (CRUD + cache invalidation)
- `use-view-preference.ts` — localStorage-backed hook for persisting table/card view mode per entity

All entity hooks filter `statecode eq 0` to return only active records.

### Utilities (`src/lib/`)

- `utils.ts` — `cn()` helper for Tailwind class merging
- `get-parent-account-id.ts` — Extracts account GUID from a contact, working around Dataverse polymorphic lookup field naming
- `azure-openai.ts` — Azure OpenAI integration for AI action item extraction. Calls a chat completion endpoint to parse meeting notes into structured action items. Configured via Vite env vars (`VITE_AOAI_ENDPOINT`, `VITE_AOAI_API_KEY`, `VITE_AOAI_DEPLOYMENT`). Maps AI priority strings to Dataverse numeric choice keys
- `tile-colors.ts` — Priority-to-color mapping for card view color-coding. Defines 5 tile colors (clear, blue, orange, red, dark-red), background CSS classes with dark-mode variants (`dark:bg-*-950/40`), `tileGradient()` for subtle priority-tinted gradient backgrounds on board cards (detects `.dark` class on `<html>` for dark-aware gradients), and localStorage helpers for entities without a Dataverse priority field (e.g., accounts)

### Generated Code (`src/generated/`, `.power/`)

Auto-generated by `pac code add-data-source`. Read-only — do not edit.

- `services/AccountsService.ts`, `services/ContactsService.ts`, `services/Tdvsp_actionitemsService.ts`, `services/Tdvsp_meetingsummariesService.ts`, `services/Tdvsp_ideasService.ts`, `services/Tdvsp_projectsService.ts` — Typed CRUD operations (HVA service still present in generated code but unused)
- `models/AccountsModel.ts`, `models/ContactsModel.ts`, `models/Tdvsp_actionitemsModel.ts`, `models/Tdvsp_meetingsummariesModel.ts`, `models/Tdvsp_ideasModel.ts`, `models/Tdvsp_projectsModel.ts` — Dataverse entity types

## Data Flow

1. Component mounts → TanStack Query hook fires → Generated service calls Dataverse via host proxy
2. User submits form → Mutation fires → `onSuccess` invalidates relevant query keys (contacts mutations also invalidate accounts)
3. Query invalidation triggers automatic refetch → UI updates

## Routing

HashRouter (`/#/accounts`, `/#/contacts`, `/#/action-items`, `/#/meeting-summaries`, `/#/ideas`, `/#/projects`, `/#/board`) — required by Power Platform host iframe which controls the outer URL.

## Theming

The app uses a Microsoft Fluent Design-inspired theme built on CSS custom properties (HSL) in `src/index.css`:

- **Primary:** Microsoft Blue (`#0078D4`) — buttons, focus rings, table headers, active states
- **Sidebar:** White/card background, collapsible from 208px to 56px via a floating chevron toggle (state persists in `localStorage`). Briefcase icon + "My Work" brand, grouped nav items with small-caps section headers (insights, activity, capture, core). Collapsed state shows icon-only with hover tooltips to the right; section labels become thin dividers. Nav icons are colored to match their quick create counterparts (red, emerald, pink, violet, teal, sky). Active item has a 3px cyan left border (`#00BCF2`) and blue text (or background tint when collapsed). "Board" is renamed to "My Board" in the insights section
- **Quick Create Bar:** Horizontal bar at top of content area with colored pill buttons (pastel backgrounds, dark-aware variants) for creating records. Order: work, personal, learning (task-type presets that pre-set `tdvsp_tasktype`), idea, meeting, project (violet), account, contact. Work/personal/learning pills open the action item form with the task type pre-selected via `QuickCreatePayload`
- **Background:** Light blue-gray (`hsl(225, 20%, 97%)`) in light mode; dark slate (`hsl(222, 20%, 10%)`) in dark mode
- **Tables:** Blue header band with white uppercase text, card-elevated wrapper with shadow. Compact density: `h-8` headers, `py-1.5` cells
- **Dialogs:** Capped at `85vh` with internal scroll for long forms
- **Typography:** Monospace font stack (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Cascadia Code, Consolas, system monospace) on `<body>` for a developer-tooling aesthetic

All colors flow through CSS variables consumed by shadcn/ui components via the `@theme inline` block in `index.css`.

### Dark Mode

Dark mode is implemented via a `ThemeProvider` context (`src/components/theme-provider.tsx`) wrapping the entire app in `App.tsx`. It toggles a `.dark` class on `<html>` and persists the choice in `localStorage`. On first visit, it respects the OS `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

Tailwind v4 integration uses `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` in `index.css` so that `dark:` utility classes work with the class-based strategy (no `prefers-color-scheme` media query at the Tailwind level).

The dark color palette is a complete set of CSS custom properties in `index.css .dark {}` — background, foreground, card, popover, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, border, input, ring, and sidebar gradient. Quick create pill buttons, tile background classes, and `tileGradient()` in `tile-colors.ts` all include dark-aware variants.

A toggle button (Sun/Moon icon) sits in the sidebar footer beneath the Ctrl+K shortcut hint.

## Dataverse Metadata Tooling (`scripts/`)

Python-based tooling for managing `TheDataverseSolution` schema from the repo. The plugin's stock `dv-connect` Python SDK is preferred for record CRUD and table/column creation; these scripts specifically cover metadata description writes, which the SDK doesn't yet expose.

- **`scripts/auth.py`** — Azure Identity credential helper shared by every Python script. Patched for **US Gov Cloud**: detects `crm9` in `DATAVERSE_URL` and uses `AzureAuthorityHosts.AZURE_GOVERNMENT` + a separate persisted auth-record file (`dataverse_cli_auth_record_gov.json`) so the GCC login doesn't collide with a commercial-cloud record on the same machine. Device code flow caches into OS credential storage; new processes silently refresh. **Do not overwrite** this file with the vanilla plugin `auth.py` without re-applying the Gov patches.
- **`scripts/list-solution-tables.py`** — SDK-based discovery. Queries `solution` where `friendlyname == "The Dataverse Solution"`, reads `solutioncomponent` rows filtered to `componenttype eq 1` (Entity), then resolves each `objectid` (MetadataId) via `/api/data/v9.2/EntityDefinitions({id})`. For `tdvsp_` tables it pulls the full attribute list (Dataverse `$filter startswith` isn't supported on MetadataEntities, so filtering is client-side). Writes a structured JSON snapshot to `solution-tables.json`.
- **`scripts/apply-descriptions.py`** — Read-modify-write loop. Reads `descriptions-plan.json`, then for each table GETs the full `EntityDefinition`, injects the new Description label, and PUTs the whole object back. Attribute descriptions require a typed cast URL (e.g. `/Attributes({MetadataId})/Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.StringAttributeMetadata`). Both requests send `MSCRM.MergeLabels: true` (preserve other-language labels) and `MSCRM.SolutionName: TheDataverseSolution` (track the change in the unmanaged solution). After all writes succeed it calls `PublishAllXml`. Failures halt the publish step.

### Why read-modify-write (not PATCH or per-property PUT)

Dataverse metadata endpoints have parity with the .NET SDK's `UpdateEntityRequest` / `UpdateAttributeRequest`, which replace the entire object. Per Microsoft Learn: *"You can't use PATCH to update data model entities… you must use PUT… and include all the existing properties that you don't intend to change. You can't update individual properties."* Attempting `PATCH EntityDefinition(...)` returns `405 Operation not supported on EntityMetadata`, and `PUT .../Description` returns `400 Argument must be of type...` because the endpoint expects a full entity body. The working pattern is: GET full object → mutate the one field → PUT the whole thing back.

## Dataverse Solution as Source of Truth

`TheDataverseSolution` is exported (unmanaged) and unpacked into `./solutions/TheDataverseSolution/` after every metadata change. The XML under `Entities/<EntityName>/Entity.xml` holds the authoritative `<Descriptions>` block for each table and column — if you need to audit what a Copilot Studio agent sees, read the solution XML rather than trusting the live environment.

```

## Non-App Artifacts

### `demo-materials/`

Companion presentation for the tech series — "Code Apps: Under the Hood." Contains `generate-deck.py` (python-pptx + fpdf2), which produces `code-apps-under-the-hood.pptx` (6-slide deck) and `code-apps-under-the-hood-talk-track.pdf` (speaker notes). The script is the single source of truth for both outputs. Slide content draws on runtime analysis from the DevTools export in `inbox/`.

### `inbox/`

Raw source artifacts. Currently contains `08587a10-83ed-43d0-8be4-8b145f5a7ee3.devtools` — an HTML export from browser DevTools of the deployed Code App, analyzed to extract runtime facts (77 scripts, 230KB localization, ClassicCanvasApp classification, 55 feature gates, `paauth`/`dynamicauth` auth, Copilot sidecar, sovereign cloud support, a11y).

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No `$select` on queries | Computed/formatted fields return zero rows when selected — omit to get all fields |
| Cross-entity cache invalidation | Contact mutations invalidate accounts queries so the account detail contact list stays fresh |
| `getParentAccountId()` helper | Dataverse returns polymorphic lookup GUIDs as `_parentcustomerid_value` at runtime, but the generated type only declares `parentcustomerid` |
| Account name resolution via `useAccounts()` | `parentcustomeridname` isn't populated by the Power Apps SDK on read — resolve names by joining with accounts data |
| Choice field labels in `labels.ts` | Dataverse choice enums use numeric keys with mangled display names — a shared labels file maps keys to human-readable strings and badge variants |
| Dashboard decomposition | The 1025-line monolithic `dashboard.tsx` was replaced with a ~225-line orchestrator importing 8 sub-components. Data computation stays centralized in the orchestrator; each sub-component is a pure rendering component receiving props. `CardShell` is exported from `status-breakdown.tsx` and shared by all chart cards |
| Dashboard CSS vars (`--dash-*`) | Separate `--dash-*` custom properties for the dashboard's Stripe/Retool aesthetic, scoped in `:root` and `.dark` blocks in `index.css`. Decoupled from the app's existing shadcn/ui HSL variables so the dashboard theme doesn't leak into other pages |
| Dashboard Inter font | Loaded via Google Fonts CDN `<link>` in `index.html`, applied via inline `fontFamily` on the dashboard container. Body stays JetBrains Mono |
| Dashboard drilldown via inline filter | Each click handler computes a filtered `ActionItem[]` inline and passes it to a shared `DrilldownDialog`. Reverse-lookup maps (`STATUS_KEY_BY_LABEL`, etc.) convert display labels back to Dataverse numeric keys |
| Customer lookup via OData bind | Action items use `tdvsp_Customer@odata.bind` with `/accounts(guid)` format for writes, `_tdvsp_customer_value` for reads — same polymorphic pattern as contacts |
| Account/Contact lookups on Ideas | Ideas use both `tdvsp_Account@odata.bind` and `tdvsp_Contact@odata.bind` for writes, with `_tdvsp_account_value` / `_tdvsp_contact_value` for reads |
| Meeting Summary account lookup | Uses `tdvsp_Account@odata.bind` for writes, `_tdvsp_account_value` for reads |
| Idea category labels in `labels.ts` | Same pattern as action item choice fields — numeric keys mapped to human-readable labels (Copilot Studio, Canvas Apps, Azure, etc.) |
| AI extraction via Azure OpenAI | Meeting summary detail view offers "Extract Action Items with AI" — calls Azure OpenAI chat completion, parses JSON response into structured action items, maps priority strings to Dataverse choice keys, and bulk-creates via the action items mutation. Gracefully degrades with a toast if env vars aren't configured |
| Command palette inside HashRouter | `CommandPalette` uses `useNavigate()` so it must be rendered inside `<HashRouter>`. Rendering it outside crashes React with a white screen |
| Client-side command palette search | Ctrl+K searches TanStack Query cache — no extra Dataverse API calls. Results grouped by entity with highlighted matches |
| Table/card view toggle | Accounts, contacts, meeting summaries, ideas, and projects support a toggle between table and card views via `useViewPreference()`. Action items use a table-only design with Compact/Rich density modes (Phase 27) |
| Priority tile color-coding | Card views show a 5-dot color picker (clear/blue/orange/red/dark-red) on hover. For action items and ideas, clicking a dot PATCHes `tdvsp_priority` in Dataverse immediately. Accounts use localStorage since they lack a priority field. Background color derived from priority via `tile-colors.ts` |
| Board (Kanban) view | A cross-entity Kanban board showing 4 columns: parking lot (pinned items, green/Car), work (wider 2fr column, dynamic accent/icon/title per active filter), projects, ideas. Cards are clickable (open edit dialogs). Custom collision detection combines closestCenter (within-column reorder) and pointerWithin (cross-column drops). Drop-target columns glow with accent color. Compact card toolbar with backdrop-blur. Car icon for park/unpark (replaces Pin). Dark-mode-aware gradients. Sort order persists in localStorage |
| Active records only | All entity hooks filter `statecode eq 0` to exclude inactive/deactivated records from all list views, dashboards, and lookups |
| Project lookups on Ideas/Meetings | Ideas and meeting summaries use `tdvsp_Project@odata.bind` → `/tdvsp_projects(guid)` for writes, `_tdvsp_project_value` for reads |
| Dark mode via class strategy | `ThemeProvider` toggles `.dark` on `<html>`, persists in localStorage, respects OS preference. Tailwind v4 `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` enables `dark:` utilities without a media query. Full CSS variable palette in `.dark {}` block |
| Monospace font stack | JetBrains Mono > Fira Code > Cascadia Code > Consolas > system monospace — developer-tooling aesthetic that reads well in data-dense tables |
| Action items list redesign (Phase 27) | Table-only with `--dash-*` design system. Saved-view tabs (All/Overdue/High/Due this week) with live counts. Subtoolbar with Group by Account, Type/Priority/Status filter pills, Compact/Rich density toggle. Collapsible account group headers with 2-letter avatar, status distribution bar. Row selection with floating bulk action bar (Framer Motion). Priority rails, type-icon tiles, overdue badges, activity dots. No card view — density modes replace it |
| Compact table density | `TableHead` reduced to `h-8 px-3`, `TableCell` to `px-3 py-1.5` — fits more rows on screen without scroll, important for demo flow |
| Custom board collision detection | Combines `closestCenter` (within-column sortable reorder) with `pointerWithin` (cross-column droppable detection). Prevents cards from "jumping" to the wrong column during drag |
| Clickable board cards | All board cards have `cursor-pointer` and `onClick` that opens the entity's edit form dialog, providing a fast path to editing without needing the pencil toolbar button |
| Copilot Studio via popup window | The agent opens in a popup window (`window.open`) instead of an iframe or Direct Line embed. The Code App's `@microsoft/power-apps` SDK uses custom `paauth`/`dynamicauth` tokens incompatible with Direct Line's SSO token exchange, and iframe embedding had CSP/auth friction. A popup window lets Copilot Studio handle its own auth natively with zero dependencies. The native Code App → Copilot Studio **connector** upgrade path (`shared_microsoftcopilotstudio` + `ExecuteCopilotAsyncV2`) was investigated and is **blocked in GCC** by an `AADSTS700030` cross-cloud cert failure in the connector's First Party OAuth2 flow — see `FAQ.md` / `MEMORY.md` / `HOW-I-WAS-BUILT.md` Phase 23 |
